### The npm-starter-template lib

---

This project is ideal for developers looking for a lightweight, dependency-free library to enhance their JavaScript
coding experience. All utilities are optimized for performance and are designed to work seamlessly across different
environments, including browsers and Node.js.

### ðŸš€ Installation

You can easily install the Common JavaScript Utilities library via npm. Simply run the following command in your project
directory:

```sh
npm i @innowhat/npm-starter-template
```

Alternatively, if you're using Yarn, you can install it with:

```shell
yarn add @innowhat/npm-starter-template
```

Once installed, you can start using the utility functions in your JavaScript or TypeScript projects by importing the
necessary modules:

```ts
// Importing specific utilities
import { ArrayUtils, StringUtils } from 'co2m.js';

// Using a utility function
const sortedArray = ArrayUtils.sortInt([5, 2, 9, 1]);
// ==> [1, 2, 5, 9]
const distinctArray = ArrayUtils.distinct<number>([12, 2, 12, 9]);
// ==> [12, 2, 9]
const formattedString = StringUtils.trim('   Hello World!   ');
// ==> 'Hello World!'
const padString = StringUtils.leftPad('1', '0', 3);
// ==> '0001'
```
