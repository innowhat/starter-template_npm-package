# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
    cd project-name
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes** in the appropriate files
2. **Write or update tests** for your changes
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add your changes to the `[Unreleased]` section:
    - Use the appropriate category: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
    - Write clear, user-focused descriptions
    - Link to relevant issues/PRs when helpful (e.g., `(#123)`)
    - **Note**: Only add to `[Unreleased]` - don't create version sections (maintainers handle releases)
4. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
5. **Build the project** to check for issues:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
6. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add: description of your changes"
    ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely
4. **Wait for review** - we'll provide feedback and work with you on any needed changes
